### Tech <a name="tech"></a>
**Object Oriented Programming** or **OOP** is a programming approach that focuses on objects. Objects are like building 
blocks that contain both data and actions. By using objects, we can make our code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand and maintain. 

Uses:
* [Python] - Programming Language

### Features <a name="feat"></a>
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Memory functionality: Store and recall values for later use.
- Error handling: Gracefully handle invalid inputs and prevent program crashes.
- User-friendly interface: Intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.

### Project Structure <a name="proj"></a>
- ui.py: It handles user interaction.(Inputting values, Printing values, etc.)
- calculator.py: Contains the various mathematical operations supported by calculator.
- main_prog.py: Contains utility functions used by the calculator.
- README.md: The readme file providing information about the project.

### Run <a name="run"></a>
     $ git clone https://github.com/miku1001/OOP-calculator.git
     $ cd OOP-calculator
     $ python main_prog.py
     $ python calculator.py
     $ python ui.py
